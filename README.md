# SilverStripe Facebook Image

This extension provides fields in both the SiteConfig and on Page. The SiteConfig image is the default fallback for all pages but one can customise which image appears on each individual page by using that page's facebook image field.


## Installation (with composer)

	$ composer require heyday/silverstripe-facebookimage

## Usage

```html
<html>
	<head>
	$FacebookMetaTags
	</head>
	<body>
		<p>Hello, world!</p>
	<body>
</html>
```

Use the `$FacebookMetaTags` variable in your silverstripe template in the <head> section.
